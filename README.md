# Analysis of the Drawing Probability

Assume there are n strands, each with billions of copies. 
A sample of size M is taken from these n strands so each draw is chosen uniformly at random. 
The plot that describes the number of strands (y axis) with a given number of copies (x axis) should have a normal distribution.
Then, another sample is taken according to the new distribution and this process repeats several time. 
The goal is to analyze how this plot changes with the number of iterations.
